probably the only time notepad has ever been used as notes


pwd - Print Working Directory

ls - List

c(w)d - Change Working Directory
if u have dementia it's actually (cd)

Paths --
aaaaAaAaAaA




























genral --


pwd takes no permaiter
\\ get crapped on //

ls (can take peramiter) _/\'-'/\_

cd (must take peramiter) grammerly halp

Command Notation --

pwd (thats it lol)

ls [Path]
(bruh the font just changed :skull:)
cd <Path>

(when command has an optional peramiter, it means the command is actually two commands bundled together, wether you give it a peramiter or not, specifies which of the two commands you will execute.)



(optional peramiter = two commands all in one command, two commands execute different things. [{(LS WITHOUT A PATH IS LISTING ALL FILES)}])
